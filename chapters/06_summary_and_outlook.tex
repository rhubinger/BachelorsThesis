\chapter{Summary and Outlook}\label{chapter:summary_and_outlook}

In this work we presented the designs of two shared memory based backends for the LAIK library.
We introduced the reader to the core functionality of LAIK and the IPC mechanisms used in the backend.
After introducing the necessary background we explained the design of our shared memory backends.
We then explained how we implemented both backends and how a backend can use the functionality of the secondary backend version to execute its data migration on shared memory.
After that we tested our backends performance and compared it against other LAIK backends.

We hope that this work can serve as the basis for future work.
It would be interesting to see the performance of the backend with an efficient implementation of memcopy linked to it.
Besides that, the approach of a 0 copy data transport where all processes work on one synchronized shared memory segment seems to be a promising approach to further increase LAIKs performance.
